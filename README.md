# work-day-scheduler

The objective is to create a small calendar application that saves events for each hour of a standard workday schedule. By using this application, the user should be able to manage time more effectively.

When the user opens the planner, they are shown the current date and time displayed at the top. Below is a day-calendar with the standard 9 am - 5 pm schedule with each hour specifically shown in an individual row. The middle column will change colors depending on the time of the day. Gray means that hour has passed already, red means it is the current hour, and green means it has yet to pass.

When the user clicks on the middle column between the hour column and the save button column, they are able to enter events. They can save this event by clicking the save button on the right of the hour row. The events for that specific hour row should persist even after reload.

Moment.js is used to format the time and date as well as used for calculating functions for the color-coding.

jQuery is used to make HTML document traversing which factored a significant portion for some of the functions.
